# wolfram-generative
CAPStone Project:
Unfortunately, saving as a script file failed to access frontend content, and saving for Wolfram Player simply displays the unexecutable code. As such, this requires [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) to run.

Mathematica is available through the UIS webstore. It provides downloads for Windows, Mac, and Linux, as well as the serial number required to authenticate the software. If the local download is not available for faculty, the Online service should be, and should allow you to run the notebook in browser. However, all testing was done on physical machines, and the program saves local files, so any errors that may be caused by the online interface are not addressed. We apologize for this inconvenience. If you are unable to run the program, we would be happy to provide a video of the program's functionality.

Images generated by the program are saved locally in the directory listed in the bottom of the program window. Because of limitations of the system, we are unable to delete these files, so if you would like to remove them post-execution, it must be done manually.

Program exit should be done through the exit button within the displayed window, to ensure proper closing of the temporary SQL Server.
